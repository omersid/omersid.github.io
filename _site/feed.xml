He demonstrates that what an individual knows for sure is exactly just that they exist: nothing more or less. Though this may seem like alarmingly little, we show that this type of thinking allows for the highest form of meaning. Here we give a quick summary of Descartes’s arguments in the first two meditations (considered the most important) and then (attempt to) consider the (most important) implications of his arguments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;b6b8ffef-7aeb-403b-93e3-d541a867551b&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;What Descartes Said&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;92ce139f-c080-4cea-ab21-6a9d4cd236c2&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In the true way of a philosopher or any logical entity, Descartes begins with questioning where he can begin. What can we take as fact? Surely, we need to be careful to not include our biases if we are to get to anything meaningful. But more than that, we need to really be sure we are beginning on solid ground. Descartes notes he can’t tell he is asleep when he is sleeping nor can he &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; rule out the idea of a malicious God with the sole purpose of tricking him. Modern viewers may also throw in that it is unclear if we are in a simulation. These difficulties noted, we find that we can’t trust anything we see or hear. We can’t trust any of our beliefs either. We don’t have much to go off of!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;3df7b8ea-b030-4d27-8880-a41f25cbbeca&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Descartes in his second mediation seizes upon the fixed point- we know that we think. Regardless if we are dreaming or if a demon is tricking us every sense and every thought, we are currently thinking. And since we think, we must exist at least as the one who thinks (we can define ourselves as the one thinking these thoughts and since the thoughts exists, so do we). &lt;em&gt;I think therefore I am&lt;/em&gt;. And furthermore, I only know I exist the moment I think and outside of that I can’t know for sure. Later he additionally argues that all we know about ourselves really is that we think and everything else is up for grabs. He also argues that whatever we can “clearly and distinctly” perceives also must exist but this line of thinking is more controversial, and we won’t employ it here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;d5013317-5d5a-485a-b0f0-a916df16d836&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

We each know that we ourselves exist, though the existence of anyone else is unclear (later philosophers will argue that since I know I exist, I can know you exist). This is a monumental moment for not only do we exist, but we know we exist. Existence has come to know itself as such. After a number of experiences, I have come to feel that knowing itself is an inevitable condition of existence, for if it wasn’t, would it even exist? We are reminded of the classic question of whether the fridge light is on when the fridge is closed (ignoring the presence of anything besides you and the fridge). Regardless of the answer, the fact we even theoretically can’t know renders the difference as insignificant to us. Reworded: the same quality that makes it unknowable to an observer makes it irrelevant to that observer. Analogously, existence that doesn’t know itself is irrelevant to itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id=&quot;dbf0b354-248c-4a39-a7a5-8f84ec1248fb&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/Fridge_Light.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width:268px&quot; src=&quot;/images/Fridge_Light.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2: A fridge light is useful for both a midnight snack and a metaphor&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;d9adcf41-29db-4552-b5fa-3a7916994ebc&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;We are the observes of existence. But then, the argument above can be extended to say that the only relevant existence is that which we interact with. And we only really interact with that which is in our minds as we are beings of thought first and foremost, and thus this is only mode of interaction truly available to us. It is quickly apparent that relevant existence is that which we think about- and I mean we as individuals. We each only know ourselves in the truest sense. And so we come to a break through, existence (or at least the relevant part of it) is that which I can think about. This may feel like mental gymnastics, but if you start with the proposition that “I think so I exist and all I know is that I can think”, it follows quite naturally that the all of universe (that which exists) is exactly which I think about. Furthermore, these aren’t different things- they exist exactly because I can think about them and I can think about them because they exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;37500855-fd1e-4eb0-8e54-d3adfe3e9c71&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Now you may think this is problematic. You may say “I can think about unicorns, but they don’t exist”. But in some sense, they do. What are you referring to as a unicorn? Why do you think they don’t exist? You define them as not existing since you believe you can’t perceive one, i.e. you’re defining reality by what can be sensed. But still, the unicorn at least has some formal existence as an idea. And why should a unicorn be any less real than a horse just because we don’t find them on earth? Because of a horn? True reality is in the idea itself, in what the unicorn represents- in what we sense around us, the truest portion isn’t their physical description but the patterns, meanings, and emotional significances they create inside us. We create existence by “observing” or considering an idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id=&quot;6d396685-90a3-4e6e-8f3d-0e4d251a27f3&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/Unicorn.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width:570px&quot; src=&quot;/images/Unicorn.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 3: A unicorn.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;bf215d70-4de1-4c91-a03f-69022f501f88&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;FRACTALS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;d0a19741-d9dc-480b-96f6-7ae2e9ee9d5f&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;And thus, in each of us is existence. This is highly nontrivial. In each of us is a version of everything. A metaphor for this idea is the ocean and a drop of the ocean. Ignoring atomic constraints, any drop of the ocean is in some way equivalent to the ocean for we just need to zoom in and then we can’t tell the difference (the concentration of all solutes is same in a representative drop as are all physical properties). Specially, a drop of water has all the information that the ocean does (metaphor is for just water and no organisms). The drop can have current, a water cycle, a hurricane, etc. The image is more than just wishful thinking- fractals are mathematical constructions with this exact property of infinite self-similarity. The fact that a fractal can be defined mathematically and there is nothing self-contradictory about an infinitely self-similar construct reveals some deep truth about reality. And far from being some simple shape which trivializes the question, these fractals can have infinitely complex structures as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;206622f3-df19-494e-a0e1-92930f3cea0d&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;We pause to highlight the amazingness of the infinite self-similarity. We could imagine that there are emergent properties that come from the pieces being together. But an infinitely self-similar shape has those same exact emergent properties already present in each piece, though at a smaller scale. No words can explain this better than watching an animation (and maybe learning the relevant math). Please note that this isn&amp;#x27;t just an animation you are watching but a mathematical truth for how this well defined set looks when zoomed in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id=&quot;a2d7f1a3-093c-45b4-abec-89bca8bf63a4&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Mandelbrot_sequence_new.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Mandelbrot_sequence_new.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 4: Zooming into the Mandelbrot set. Note the self-similarity and complexity.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;e3fbc3a1-5df4-4728-a78c-2eddb0a5ad20&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Inside me there are galaxies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;335c1353-dbcd-4edf-89ac-39ae3be4c947&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Taken as a model for the relation of the human (the drop) to the universe (the ocean), we expect that we find everything to ever exist inside of us, albeit at different scales and orientation. All the plot lines to every book or movie, stars in distant planets and quarks in atoms, all feeling ever felt or will be felt all exist inside us, whether or not we are conscious of it. Though this may seem ridiculous at first, it in fact is extremely natural. The fact you can conceive of a planet in a different solar system means you have that inside you. The power of imagination is far more real than we usually realize- if the only objective reality we have is that fact we have thoughts, how can the thoughts we have be insignificant, as people often feel? People will think “So what if I can conceive of the moon, it nearly as real as being there”. But the approach we have taken here points to the exact opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;0c9fb1c1-dfcb-47fa-a78a-223b4260c956&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;The reason we feel “being there” is more real than imagining being there is that we over value our sensory perception. Really, we define our reality by our sensory perception most of the time. This is the &lt;em&gt;modus operandi&lt;/em&gt; of the human race and, without going into the specifics, there are clear reasons it is that way. What I am pointing out is that for matters of meaning, purpose, and ideas beyond what we can label as actions necessary for survival, this absolute trust of the sense and lack of belief in that which is beyond the senses limits our potential. Surely, that which we perceive is a narrow subset of that which we can imagine. It is even a strict subset of that which we can imagine sensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id=&quot;3dad0580-eb18-4270-94ff-0a7d7065d1d8&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/Galaxy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width:788px&quot; src=&quot;/images/Galaxy.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 5: Galaxies are large and pretty. They exist inside each of us. (Picture courtesy the Hubble Telescope)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;3739e36e-d36a-45e7-a7e1-83724e30f78a&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;So what?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;30cfecff-5c3d-44e0-915e-899af3f271c4&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;There are many implications of the realization that the universe exists inside each of us. Though your sensory reality may be affected by external factors, you are not a cog in the wheel, you are not a slave to the system, you are not an outsider to existence. I’m driving at a paradigm shift. Your universe would not exist without you. Maybe no one’s would. Sartre says “I am thus responsible for myself and for all men, and I am creating a certain image of man as I would have him to be. In fashioning myself I fashion man.” Each decision you make is a decision on behalf of all of existence, each difficulty you encounter is a difficulty encountered by all of existence, each loss you encounter is a loss to all of existence, each triumph you achieve is a victory for all of existence. The meaning you create is the only meaning that exists. The power of this realization cannot be understated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;b0d0b584-6a4a-4759-b204-b1c3dfe4becb&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Archimedes theorized with a large enough lever and exactly one fixed point for the fulcrum, he could move the planet with his finger. One fixed point and we can physically move planets! Let the realization that you truly exist and, in finding yourself existing, you also find all of existence inside you be the fixed point, which is unwavering in the face of anything else. From there, you are a conscious part of existence, and in choosing to be so, have the opportunity to create all meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id=&quot;ac15aa14-cc73-421d-94fd-b2014cc97ed7&quot; class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/Archimedes_Lever.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width:640px&quot; src=&quot;/images/Archimedes_Lever.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 6: Archimedes just doing his thing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;46a84974-afc5-4aa3-ba63-94e121bab4c8&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;dc667c37-7970-4214-9a70-37c5ddd730a8&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Egoistically, it is not enough for one to feel right about something and not try to explain that to others. If i believe I&amp;#x27;m right, is it not my duty to explain that to others. The foundational ideas of proselytization, the war for truth is deep in human nature, and has so  been exploited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;d0ca3ff8-4c1a-4a79-ab4c-4e0dfb9e06cf&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;5321fad7-d098-4207-a054-f28477aef74e&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;most beliefs cannot be right. simply, because, you are rarely strictly right. more often you are just not wrong yet. Sadly, the real issue here is that humans don&amp;#x27;t like being wrong which allows them to stay safe in their mind. if you wish to point out that someone is wrong, you will have to deal with being disliked. if you shatter the ground on which people stand (religion, or other centralized dogmatic belief), you must ask yourself — did you provide them another ground, before dropping them into the chaos of cognitive dissonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;4299aeea-b9fc-434b-8bf3-55f424e3a2fb&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;85cefba0-df90-42e8-9427-3b5dedbad0ff&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;In plato&amp;#x27;s Euthyphro we have socrates; engaging in an argument, and he asks his opponent to define &amp;#x27;piety&amp;#x27;. Socrates asks questions as though he does not know the answer, and has Euthyphro happily create the definitions, which he will be forced into contradicting. As a reprise, Socrates is sentenced to death in the Apology, for such things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;78ac801b-2bfc-4076-a07e-42163ea980bf&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;b9420c0d-5380-4a47-a8f4-ee2417226a8e&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;this brings me to the question, asked by those wanting to change something, make things better. probably asked by so so many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;6d7c35c6-d120-4c12-829c-355fb5c27b37&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;c5221f8a-e014-4e2e-906a-b6dc7ea2d6c4&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;religions and various other &amp;#x27;isms&amp;#x27; seem to have basically implemented,  teaching infallibility, and then using dissonance to make sure people stay. of course they have their merits, but if something is easy to enter and hard to leave. how then is it not a trap — just like Socrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;0f3e3f32-0db7-488d-b6f4-37aa6db4cfa8&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;adeede3e-43e8-4d4e-b98f-ddee9c71babc&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;anyways, back to simply changing the world. solving problems. We want to to be doing it without exposing vulnerabilities in society, without causing unrest, without people losing their faith in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;5c4c291a-b67f-4cd3-a3c4-d096a03ce350&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

But you should trust us now with this new information. that is obviously a bad fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;8bcff372-f3f6-48ef-8d55-22cff7292b79&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;3b470de6-70ce-4654-8086-61a813de150d&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;sure rapid catastrophic changes can be good in the long run. but in thinking thats the best way, is definitely crazy. because it seems to neglect loss is harder to stomach, than gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;378e7222-3ce7-4b47-9c04-0ca0fdd94ccd&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;20b51dec-5c9b-4309-a2a4-f5460b8a098b&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;with certain things its easy to want to be wrong. I want to be wrong about nutrition, urban planning, climate, economy because it&amp;#x27;s easy to see things aren&amp;#x27;t working as they might ideally, even without all of the random scientist&amp;#x27;s confounding variables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;ef5b6f10-7520-445c-8c8c-59b7d16e86b3&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

So many people don&amp;#x27;t seem to understand that. And I believe, all you can do to change their minds is plant seeds and let time nurture them slowly, carefully. If you don&amp;#x27;t have time, maybe tell there there moms to tell them or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;a0c27159-86d2-4984-8080-36460aab5a7a&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;bba6779e-a937-4b12-8cff-7eae741b5aef&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;Time will remove what is wrong. But by then you will be long gone. don&amp;#x27;t try to fix the world out of pride, or revenge, its to murky.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;ed8ee9b9-2dc3-4b1d-a9cd-a14bf06d375e&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;as i write this. I&amp;#x27;m struck that there&amp;#x27;s important nuance here. I&amp;#x27;m only saying that to make me feel better to protect myself and feel safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;7dc7ecf6-f008-449e-b926-a699374de92e&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;33de90fd-8e10-471e-bb73-fdae0fd78d96&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;so fine. Expose those who expose others. Call out those who cause the ruin of others. Ignorance is fine, I respect it as a noble solution to the problem of knowledge. But f**k those who cause ruin for others. Sometimes that ruin is so easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;6cb65438-19df-4ed3-93ff-a409c462eb5c&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;0ca52411-0508-4308-b206-d5171fdb0d99&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;BUT D**N, we are back to loss aversion, how can i hurt people to help people. I must extend something better. in something like climate change, we have economic interests in fossil fuels conflicting with the planetary interest in solar panels. The issue is politics plays on two things, the working man who is employed by fossil fuels vs. the rich movie stars who speak for the climate. And in the same way, the poor affected by diminishing air qualities, crops, diseases vs some oil billionaire. Did either side extend solutions for the other ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;8bbfa885-df4a-45cd-8e1f-bbe82b4fa083&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;6cc22ebc-afde-420b-ac68-0b6768b6e6dc&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;God, stop giving us trolley problems and asking the majority to pull the lever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;48059e06-1151-40b3-b603-96ef2d38470a&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;bd03cf07-7ed2-4ff4-9604-82c576e341b4&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;the trolley problem is the worst. luckily this isn&amp;#x27;t a philosophy textbook. you and nature simultaneously write the rules. remove the tracks, build another track, get the people off the tracks, stop the goddamn train. do them all at once, and just f**king hope you did it in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;8cfa56e6-7dd1-4e3d-994a-9ea5f64ed5d8&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;c3273ad5-c91e-4942-b25e-5e9c24f60008&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;its not a game, and i don&amp;#x27;t mean to game-ify it. but seriously, does anyone qualified to try even try these days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;aa3ea781-06a5-4e60-a76b-8688dcb3e80b&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

I don&amp;#x27;t mean to provide non-practical statements. but I don&amp;#x27;t have time to do everything myself. you shouldn&amp;#x27;t care too much to show that you are right, that you have read more, that you have considered this and that and that. you will get to it eventually. don&amp;#x27;t beat yourself up about it now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;7eee5cea-439f-4291-9ab7-d1a887f85426&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;19db59a7-4f78-446c-8bca-4ce3f4cbd068&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;ultimately, you should be concerned with harm associated with knowledge. is not fixing this gonna hurt ? is fixing this gonna hurt ? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;7b0c63b7-fb12-46ef-b172-da3f265bf693&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;and ultimately how can i make the fix not hurt ? this doesn&amp;#x27;t have to be a zero sum game for anyone if you do things slowly, and carefully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;0dea8674-ddce-416e-b6e5-960a1cbd9e4b&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;

I didn’t expect to, but within a short time, I’ve come to believe it to be a necessary read. I can’t and I won’t explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, a major motif in the book is aesthetics and form. The message is that beauty is not skin deep. It’s an expression of nature. And stop — even human beauty is not reducible to some genetic lottery; peoples far more primitive know this. Beauty is nature’s way to express itself; a lack of it should be startling; beauty is not superficial, and should not be ignored. It’s a sign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fractals.png&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;My mind yearns for fractals and so does yours.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beauty is very objective. Beauty was not taught to us. The natural world is hardwired with fractals and dynamic symmetry. Why wouldn’t our brain be. But maybe you knew this already. And this isn’t my point. Aesthetics is a tool because beauty is a symptom of things occurring in accordance with nature. Simply, I mean to suggest, our society has forgotten that beauty is about nature. We have constructed systems which do not support this. Usually, in the name of science, or efficiency, or worse — money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the last century, humans have made decisions removing ourselves from nature using skeptical empiricism and time now exposes these fragilities. The outcome a deepening distance between the human world and the natural. Naive metrics (ala social scientists, WHO) says society is advancing, I will restate this saying there are two forces at work. One advancing society in metrics, and the other is hidden / smoothed over and it is happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;the world likes noise, variation, it makes it stronger. stop exposing it to catastrophe, smoothing small problems over. &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;your mind yearns for fractals, variations, noise. why wouldn't the economy, government, your body, ecosystems... need for it too?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern medicine is smoothing over the symptoms of our disconnect to natural food and environments with ever more complex treatments. Maybe we should have looked into the source of our lack of beauty. The myopia, stunted jaw growth, obesity, autoimmune conditions, cancer. These are signs of our modern failings rather than an opportunity to smooth it over with a new pill, and create and encourage an entirely new way for humans to suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same fashion …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments prop up institutions so large, over optimized, because they cannot fail. A company merges to protect itself from competing. The individual dodges a problem, until the problem engulfs them. Nature demands failures, bottom up and top down. The epidemic exposes fragilities of globalism, without strong localism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m far from believing we’re without hope. The world is a complex complex system. It’s beyond resilient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if something isn't beautiful. stop being afraid and honestly look into why&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-ps-that-i-wrote-prior&quot;&gt;A P.S. that I wrote prior.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it seems that there is so much to write about, so much to think about, so much to learn, so much to do. the list expands daily — more everyday than i am necessarily able to check off. and there’s no time to take solace in what you’ve done, because that which remains unknown looks at you menacingly. a subtle way of reminding — that which you haven’t done, that which you don’t know is still important to you. not just psychologically, but deeply in something representative of our nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now i want to explore two points. the knowing of what you don’t know, and the knowing of what you haven’t done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;knowing of what you don't know is your responsibility.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it protects you from ruin. collect the list of what you want to learn, a library, a list, and let it tower over you. let what you don’t know remind you to be deeply open minded, tolerant, and loving. let it demonstrate the nuance between information and wisdom. this demonstrates the purpose in Umberto Eco’s library — overemphasizing about what you know is stupid, focus far more on what you dont know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is not to belittle your accomplishments, or to tell you you are not an expert in something. that you can’t be confident in something. but to somehow behold yourself to larger forces of complexity against the heuristics of the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now… what you haven’t done. the meaning here is profoundly different than knowing what you don’t know. ‘doing’ requires effort, risk, time, luck — things that are not cheap. ‘doing’ requires more than just openness. So, I want to express that I’m writing what i want to do, not as some contract that stipulates that i cannot be happy until X Y Z are fulfilled. Rather to consider these wants stoically. With a deep understanding that at any moment you want to be ready to die, and not to feel regret. The honest belief that when you became awakened you did everything you could, with whatever you had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arriverdverci a tutti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Con amore,&lt;/p&gt;

If you haven’t heard it yet, go ahead and give it a listen (link). The instrumental is legendary, and the guitar solo may be one of the best of all time. Here, we’ll take a look into the enigmatic lyrics, armed with the techniques of close reading and analyzing conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of the lyrics that is immediately clear is the usage of extended metaphors and symbolism. These metaphors establish a tone and invoke certain feelings in the listener without exactly fleshing out any specific message from the band. Instead, the metaphors and symbols rely on broad pattern recognition, allowing for a high degree of generalizability and for creative interpretations unique to the listener.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stairway-to-heaven&quot;&gt;“Stairway To Heaven”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(1) There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
(2) And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
(3) When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
(4) With a word she can get what she came for.
(5) Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
(6) There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
(7) 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
(8) In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
(9) Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first verse describes a lady in the third person. The characterization that she’s “sure all that glitters is gold” is largely negative and invokes images of materialism and superficiality. Believing that all that glitters is gold means that she seemingly naively wants anything that looks good. This description calls into question the “stairway to heaven”. If this woman is known to want all that glitters, the immediate juxtaposition suggests that the stairway to heaven is just that: something that glitters and in fact may not be gold. Her idea of heaven is that it is place that even if the stores are closed, she can get what she wants. Note the repeated use of consumerist language with “buying” and now the reference to “stores”. We question if getting anything you want should really be a defining trait of heaven, compared to ideals such as fulfillment, peace, and love. It is quite unclear what buying this stairway entails, besides the fact that it is something that this woman can apparently do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of the first verse zooms out a bit. Line 7 has the first mention of “you”, though only in passing. We’ll admit we don’t have much to go off of for line 6-7. One guess is that heaven can have two meanings, as it means one thing to this woman and may mean something else to the speaker. The image of the songbird represents the first reference to nature (“tree by the brook”). The songbird warns that maybe all of our thoughts lead to apprehension, a pessimistic reflection on the story of this lady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(10) Ooh, it makes me wonder,
(11) Ooh, it makes me wonder.

(12) There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
(13) And my spirit is crying for leaving.
(14) In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
(15) And the voices of those who stand looking.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 2 is centered on the speaker. Looking to the west, the direction of the setting sun, has historically been connected to thinking about what happens after biological death. The speaker’s spirit wants to leave, presumably go join whatever exists past the setting sun in the land of those who have left. The speaker justifies this longing with his negative thoughts of “rings of smoke” in the tree- which can be interpreted as a burning forest or a forest with many campfires, possibly indicative of an approaching army or some other human source. There is synesthesia with the speaker having “seen” the voices of those who stand looking. Combined with the whole incident being “in my thoughts”, it is suggested that maybe the incident is part of a dream or a psychedelic experience. Those who stand looking may refer to the other entities one can come into contact with in such an experience. We won’t expound on these entities here but plan to investigate them thoroughly at another time. These entities stand looking, seemingly distraught by the destruction of nature. This marks an emotionally low point in the song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(16) Ooh, it makes me wonder,
(17) Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

(18) And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
(19) Then the piper will lead us to reason.
(20) And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
(21) And the forests will echo with laughter.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 3 reveals possible salvation after the negative images of the consumerist lady and the destruction of nature. Lines 18-19 play with the idiom: he who pays the piper calls the tune. The idea is whoever pays for the music can choose what is played. Here the idiom is subverted: we are the ones calling the tune, not the piper. As we all must call the tune, the tune seems to be universal and something that everyone has access to. The piper is still present and can be interpreted as the originator of this tune. In some ways, the piper is to be identified with the metaphysical, a cosmic background force that leads the tune we are all to call. Still, the agency of the piper is limited as we are the ones calling the tune not the piper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we do call the tune, we will be led to reason. The imagery of a new day dawning connects to the looking to the west earlier and is a common religious motif (i.e. a new day will dawn for the believers in Jesus Christ, the day being resurrection and heaven). Note the repeated usage of the phrase “those who stand” (lines 15, 20), tying the salvation back to the entities. The forests echoing with laughter suggests that nature is no longer harmed, and the previously concerned entities are now happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are left asking a number of questions. Who or what is the piper? What does this magical tune entail? Additionally, this whole premise is introduced as passively whispered in line 18. It feels like a secret, an urban legend, a rumor, slowly spread person to person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just now the drums kick in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(22) If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
(23) It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
(24) Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
(25) There's still time to change the road you're on.
(26) And it makes me wonder.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This verse heralds the possibility of change. A bustle in the hedgerow refers to noise in the hedges lining one’s property, which can be understood metaphorically as an idea that challenges you. Spring clears out the old and brings the new. In the long run, the road you’re on can be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(27) Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
(28) The piper's calling you to join him,
(29) Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
(30) Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker connects all that has been said now with you the listener. Your head is humming, and this is explained as the piper’s call. Here the lady from the first verse is addressed directly, leading us to question if the earlier verses were addressed to her as well. She is asked if she can hear the wind, which presumably carries the whispers mentioned in lines 18-21. The speaker telling the lady that she can change her road in the previous verse is consistent with the speaker’s anti-consumerist mentality mixed with a goal of environmental conservation. The final image is that her stairway to heaven “lies on the whispering wind”. My interpretation of this image is that a true path to salvation would have its basis in listening to this whispering wind, in calling the tune, and connecting with the piper. This description is in contrast to something that can be bought, reflecting a second meaning of a stairway to heaven as alluded to in line 7 and line 24. Physically, a stairway on wind doesn’t have strong support (compared to a stairway built on a solid surface). Her stairway is the wrong way of going about finding heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;romanticism-aside&quot;&gt;Romanticism Aside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of a whispering wind that spreads the message of some transcendent power plays a large role in English Romanticism. Percy Shelley writes “Make me thy lyre…be through my lips to unawakened Earth the trump of a prophecy!” in Ode to West Wind. The image of him as a lyre for the metaphysical force identified with the West Wind is parallel to the idea of us calling a tune made by the piper. Other parallels include the emphasis on nature and the cycle of death and living. Here we had ideas of looking west and of a new day dawning- Shelley writes “Drive my thoughts over the universe like withered leaves to quicken a new birth”. A key difference is that role of speaker. In Stairway to Heaven, the speaker doesn’t reflect on his role, though clearly in making the song and addresses its audience they do play a role, whereas Shelley is hyper-cognizant of the role the poet plays in the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Guitar solo]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Jimmy Page (the guitarist) explains how their design for the song was for the it to unfold and gain emotion and intensity as the song progressed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=495&amp;amp;v=DDo4CA13LbY&amp;amp;feature=emb_title). The guitar solo feels like the peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(31) And as we wind on down the road
(32) Our shadows taller than our soul.
(33) There walks a lady we all know
(34) Who shines white light and wants to show
(35) How everything still turns to gold.
(36) And if you listen very hard
(37) The tune will come to you at last.
(38) When all are one and one is all
(39) To be a rock and not to roll.

(40) And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the speaker sings “we wind on down the road”, we feel the song winding down and giving some resolution to our previous questions. Shadows growing taller than our soul is a nice image that physically makes sense as shadows get longer with the sun being at a lower angle, indicative of the end of the day. The image has a plethora of interpretations, including the shadow as a legacy which is larger than oneself. The tune is explained as when “all are one and one is all”. The idea of everything being one can have a whole article to itself and its many iterations throughout different cultures and philosophies. We’ll just note the idea of unity and connectedness between people that the tune entails. The pun on line 39 is again a very open-ended image. One interpretation is being a rock and not rolling means coming to the end of your journey in the individual sense (like a rock that has rolled down a hill and is now still). After going through the tumult of different ideas, being at one with the piper is the resting point. Bob Dylan’s song “Like a Rolling Stone” came out 6 years before and compares being like a rolling stone to being without a home and on your own (amazing song, you should listen to that also), accentuating the positive characterisitics of not rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now turn our attention to the lady. Her description of shining white light gives a stereotypical angelic quality. This angelic quality reflects a continued theme of religious association with the lady. She wants to show how everything can be turned to gold, showing a persisting materialistic mentality. The last line seems to suggest the meaninglessness of what the lady is engaged in. She misses the point that the tune is something that comes from within and is universal, instead looking upwards for heaven which is additionally conflated with materialism. The conflation of religion and materialism may seem paradoxical. It can be understood as the religion being metaphorical as a religion of money and work. It could also be a commentary on the state of modern American religion- criticizing ideas such as those in The Protestant Work Ethic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a clear dichotomy of symbols- the stairway which is bought involves looking upward and outward for a heaven with stores, whereas the wind is a force that belongs to earth, is tied intimately with nature, and the tune is something we can call ourselves. The piper has some transcendent quality, but it is still very much a force of this world and not of something above or external. The piper can be interpreted as some sort of collective human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note that this was a very specific reading of the song centered on understanding the tune and the piper. Other readings can take into account the numerous references to Lord of the Rings or a reading that identifies the lady with organized religion (buying the stairway with good deeds or even indulgences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a live performance, Jimmy Page begins with “This is a song of hope”. There is a humanistic thread throughout that humans don’t need to look upward and instead have the capacity themselves to unite and usher in the dawn of a new day. It is with this hope that we ultimately aim to find the tune and spread it to others.&lt;/p&gt;
