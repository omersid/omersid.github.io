    <p>“Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin is one of the defining songs of American rock and roll. If you haven’t heard it yet, go ahead and give it a listen (link). The instrumental is legendary, and the guitar solo may be one of the best of all time. Here, we’ll take a look into the enigmatic lyrics, armed with the techniques of close reading and analyzing conventions.</p>

<p>An important part of the lyrics that is immediately clear is the usage of extended metaphors and symbolism. These metaphors establish a tone and invoke certain feelings in the listener without exactly fleshing out any specific message from the band. Instead, the metaphors and symbols rely on broad pattern recognition, allowing for a high degree of generalizability and for creative interpretations unique to the listener.</p>

<h2 id="stairway-to-heaven">“Stairway To Heaven”</h2>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(1) There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
(2) And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
(3) When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
(4) With a word she can get what she came for.
(5) Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
(6) There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
(7) 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
(8) In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
(9) Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first verse describes a lady in the third person. The characterization that she’s “sure all that glitters is gold” is largely negative and invokes images of materialism and superficiality. Believing that all that glitters is gold means that she seemingly naively wants anything that looks good. This description calls into question the “stairway to heaven”. If this woman is known to want all that glitters, the immediate juxtaposition suggests that the stairway to heaven is just that: something that glitters and in fact may not be gold. Her idea of heaven is that it is place that even if the stores are closed, she can get what she wants. Note the repeated use of consumerist language with “buying” and now the reference to “stores”. We question if getting anything you want should really be a defining trait of heaven, compared to ideals such as fulfillment, peace, and love. It is quite unclear what buying this stairway entails, besides the fact that it is something that this woman can apparently do.</p>

<p>The second half of the first verse zooms out a bit. Line 7 has the first mention of “you”, though only in passing. We’ll admit we don’t have much to go off of for line 6-7. One guess is that heaven can have two meanings, as it means one thing to this woman and may mean something else to the speaker. The image of the songbird represents the first reference to nature (“tree by the brook”). The songbird warns that maybe all of our thoughts lead to apprehension, a pessimistic reflection on the story of this lady.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(10) Ooh, it makes me wonder,
(11) Ooh, it makes me wonder.

(12) There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
(13) And my spirit is crying for leaving.
(14) In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
(15) And the voices of those who stand looking.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Verse 2 is centered on the speaker. Looking to the west, the direction of the setting sun, has historically been connected to thinking about what happens after biological death. The speaker’s spirit wants to leave, presumably go join whatever exists past the setting sun in the land of those who have left. The speaker justifies this longing with his negative thoughts of “rings of smoke” in the tree- which can be interpreted as a burning forest or a forest with many campfires, possibly indicative of an approaching army or some other human source. There is synesthesia with the speaker having “seen” the voices of those who stand looking. Combined with the whole incident being “in my thoughts”, it is suggested that maybe the incident is part of a dream or a psychedelic experience. Those who stand looking may refer to the other entities one can come into contact with in such an experience. We won’t expound on these entities here but plan to investigate them thoroughly at another time. These entities stand looking, seemingly distraught by the destruction of nature. This marks an emotionally low point in the song.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(16) Ooh, it makes me wonder,
(17) Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

(18) And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
(19) Then the piper will lead us to reason.
(20) And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
(21) And the forests will echo with laughter.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Verse 3 reveals possible salvation after the negative images of the consumerist lady and the destruction of nature. Lines 18-19 play with the idiom: he who pays the piper calls the tune. The idea is whoever pays for the music can choose what is played. Here the idiom is subverted: we are the ones calling the tune, not the piper. As we all must call the tune, the tune seems to be universal and something that everyone has access to. The piper is still present and can be interpreted as the originator of this tune. In some ways, the piper is to be identified with the metaphysical, a cosmic background force that leads the tune we are all to call. Still, the agency of the piper is limited as we are the ones calling the tune not the piper.</p>

<p>And if we do call the tune, we will be led to reason. The imagery of a new day dawning connects to the looking to the west earlier and is a common religious motif (i.e. a new day will dawn for the believers in Jesus Christ, the day being resurrection and heaven). Note the repeated usage of the phrase “those who stand” (lines 15, 20), tying the salvation back to the entities. The forests echoing with laughter suggests that nature is no longer harmed, and the previously concerned entities are now happy.</p>

<p>We are left asking a number of questions. Who or what is the piper? What does this magical tune entail? Additionally, this whole premise is introduced as passively whispered in line 18. It feels like a secret, an urban legend, a rumor, slowly spread person to person.</p>

<p>And just now the drums kick in.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(22) If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
(23) It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
(24) Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
(25) There's still time to change the road you're on.
(26) And it makes me wonder.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This verse heralds the possibility of change. A bustle in the hedgerow refers to noise in the hedges lining one’s property, which can be understood metaphorically as an idea that challenges you. Spring clears out the old and brings the new. In the long run, the road you’re on can be changed.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(27) Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
(28) The piper's calling you to join him,
(29) Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
(30) Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The speaker connects all that has been said now with you the listener. Your head is humming, and this is explained as the piper’s call. Here the lady from the first verse is addressed directly, leading us to question if the earlier verses were addressed to her as well. She is asked if she can hear the wind, which presumably carries the whispers mentioned in lines 18-21. The speaker telling the lady that she can change her road in the previous verse is consistent with the speaker’s anti-consumerist mentality mixed with a goal of environmental conservation. The final image is that her stairway to heaven “lies on the whispering wind”. My interpretation of this image is that a true path to salvation would have its basis in listening to this whispering wind, in calling the tune, and connecting with the piper. This description is in contrast to something that can be bought, reflecting a second meaning of a stairway to heaven as alluded to in line 7 and line 24. Physically, a stairway on wind doesn’t have strong support (compared to a stairway built on a solid surface). Her stairway is the wrong way of going about finding heaven.</p>

<h2 id="romanticism-aside">Romanticism Aside</h2>
<p>The idea of a whispering wind that spreads the message of some transcendent power plays a large role in English Romanticism. Percy Shelley writes “Make me thy lyre…be through my lips to unawakened Earth the trump of a prophecy!” in Ode to West Wind. The image of him as a lyre for the metaphysical force identified with the West Wind is parallel to the idea of us calling a tune made by the piper. Other parallels include the emphasis on nature and the cycle of death and living. Here we had ideas of looking west and of a new day dawning- Shelley writes “Drive my thoughts over the universe like withered leaves to quicken a new birth”. A key difference is that role of speaker. In Stairway to Heaven, the speaker doesn’t reflect on his role, though clearly in making the song and addresses its audience they do play a role, whereas Shelley is hyper-cognizant of the role the poet plays in the cycle.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[Guitar solo]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In an interview, Jimmy Page (the guitarist) explains how their design for the song was for the it to unfold and gain emotion and intensity as the song progressed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=495&amp;v=DDo4CA13LbY&amp;feature=emb_title). The guitar solo feels like the peak.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(31) And as we wind on down the road
(32) Our shadows taller than our soul.
(33) There walks a lady we all know
(34) Who shines white light and wants to show
(35) How everything still turns to gold.
(36) And if you listen very hard
(37) The tune will come to you at last.
(38) When all are one and one is all
(39) To be a rock and not to roll.

(40) And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As the speaker sings “we wind on down the road”, we feel the song winding down and giving some resolution to our previous questions. Shadows growing taller than our soul is a nice image that physically makes sense as shadows get longer with the sun being at a lower angle, indicative of the end of the day. The image has a plethora of interpretations, including the shadow as a legacy which is larger than oneself. The tune is explained as when “all are one and one is all”. The idea of everything being one can have a whole article to itself and its many iterations throughout different cultures and philosophies. We’ll just note the idea of unity and connectedness between people that the tune entails. The pun on line 39 is again a very open-ended image. One interpretation is being a rock and not rolling means coming to the end of your journey in the individual sense (like a rock that has rolled down a hill and is now still). After going through the tumult of different ideas, being at one with the piper is the resting point. Bob Dylan’s song “Like a Rolling Stone” came out 6 years before and compares being like a rolling stone to being without a home and on your own (amazing song, you should listen to that also), accentuating the positive characterisitics of not rolling.</p>

<p>We now turn our attention to the lady. Her description of shining white light gives a stereotypical angelic quality. This angelic quality reflects a continued theme of religious association with the lady. She wants to show how everything can be turned to gold, showing a persisting materialistic mentality. The last line seems to suggest the meaninglessness of what the lady is engaged in. She misses the point that the tune is something that comes from within and is universal, instead looking upwards for heaven which is additionally conflated with materialism. The conflation of religion and materialism may seem paradoxical. It can be understood as the religion being metaphorical as a religion of money and work. It could also be a commentary on the state of modern American religion- criticizing ideas such as those in The Protestant Work Ethic.</p>

<p>There is a clear dichotomy of symbols- the stairway which is bought involves looking upward and outward for a heaven with stores, whereas the wind is a force that belongs to earth, is tied intimately with nature, and the tune is something we can call ourselves. The piper has some transcendent quality, but it is still very much a force of this world and not of something above or external. The piper can be interpreted as some sort of collective human spirit.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We note that this was a very specific reading of the song centered on understanding the tune and the piper. Other readings can take into account the numerous references to Lord of the Rings or a reading that identifies the lady with organized religion (buying the stairway with good deeds or even indulgences).</p>

<p>In a live performance, Jimmy Page begins with “This is a song of hope”. There is a humanistic thread throughout that humans don’t need to look upward and instead have the capacity themselves to unite and usher in the dawn of a new day. It is with this hope that we ultimately aim to find the tune and spread it to others.</p>
